        <p class="p2"> 
            This website itself has been one of my most recent projects. 
        </p>
        <p class="p2"> 
            The entire site was coded from scratch using html on Visual Studio Code. I had to learn how
            to effectively code using both html and CSS. I did not need to build the website using this method, since easier methods exist,  
            but I believed this would be a fun and valuable learning process.
        </p>
        <p class="p2"> 
            Through the process of building this website I have expanded my understanding of
            different coding languages and how web design pieces together.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            Please explore my website and various projects to get a better understanding of who I am as a creator and artist! Thank you!
